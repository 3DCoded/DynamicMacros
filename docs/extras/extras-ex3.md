# Example 3: KlipperMaintenance

This last example of the Klippy extra development tutorial is actually one of my other Klipper projects: [KlipperMaintenance](https://github.com/3DCoded/KlipperMaintenance), a maintenance reminder system for Klipper.

This example will go through how the KlipperMaintenance code works to teach a few more important things about developing Klippy extras.

## Full Code

For this tutorial, we'll start with the full code, then break it down and explain what each section does. If you can learn to read existing Klippy extras, you can read the [builtin Klippy extras](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/tree/master/klippy/extras) when developing your own extras.
